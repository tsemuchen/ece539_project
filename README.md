# Waste Classification Using CNNs

## Description

This repository implements a training pipeline for deep learning models, focusing on feature extraction, fine-tuning, and model evaluation. Currently, the pipeline uses the DenseNet121 model, with plans to implement and compare additional pre-trained models in the future.

## Features

- Feature extraction and fine-tuning pipeline for transfer learning.
- Evaluation of model performance on specific datasets.
- Currently supports DenseNet121, with plans for future expansions to other pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG).
